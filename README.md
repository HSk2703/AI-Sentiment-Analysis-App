# Programming Project
Created an AI-based sentiment analysis application using Watson NLP embedded libraries.

Formatted the output received from the Watson NLP library function to extract relevant information from it.

Packaged the application and made it importable to any Python code for usage.

Ran unit tests on the application and checked the validity of its outputs for different inputs.

Deployed the application using the Flask framework.

Incorporated error handling capability in the application, such that a response code of 500 receives an appropriate response from the application.

Ran static code analysis on the code files to confirm their adherence to the PEP8 guidelines.
